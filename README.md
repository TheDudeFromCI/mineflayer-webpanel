## Description

The goal of this project is to make working with Mineflayer bots significantly easier to do without the need for any programming knowledge. The web GUI allows for control over most core functions available to standard vanilla clients. This should make it easy to create and manage bots in order to preform tedious tasks or functions on your server with little to no supervision.
